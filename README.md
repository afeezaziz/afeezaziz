Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Afeez Aziz, a software engineer and entrepreneur deeply passionate about building the *future* â€“ a future powered by the convergence of Web3 and Artificial Intelligence. I'm originally from Malaysia, with experience spanning the UK and Southeast Asia's vibrant tech scene. I don't just want to build software; I want to build *systems* that fundamentally change how we interact with technology and the world around us. I'm an "online gardener" (Pekebun atas talian in Malay) â€“ I cultivate digital ecosystems and nurture innovative ideas.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer, but my real passion lies in architecting solutions from the ground up. I thrive on the challenge of taking a concept from its initial spark to a fully realized, deployed, and marketed product. I'm particularly driven by the transformative potential of decentralized technologies and the incredible power of AI â€“ and I believe their intersection is where the most groundbreaking innovations will emerge.

## My Skills & Experience

My technical skills are constantly evolving, but here's a snapshot of my core capabilities:

*   **Full-Stack Web Development (Web2 & Web3 - My Playground):**
    *   **Frontend:** I'm fluent in modern JavaScript frameworks like Angular (versions 2 and 4 are my old friends). I love crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences, whether it's integrating complex mapping solutions with Mapbox GL Draw or building dynamic visualizations using Plotly.js.
    *   **Backend:** Python's my go-to for server-side logic, leveraging frameworks like Flask and Jinja2. I'm comfortable working with databases (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy) and optimizing them for performance.
    *   **Web3:** This isn't just a buzzword for me; it's my core focus. I'm deeply embedded in the Solana ecosystem, actively building with web3.js and solana-program. My vision is to be the *go-to resource* for Web3 development â€“ I want to empower others to build the decentralized future, handling everything from development and operations to crafting a compelling market presence.
    * **Mobile Development:** I am capable of making mobile applications using Flutter and Dart.

*   **Embedded Systems (Bridging the Physical and Digital):**
    *   I have practical experience with the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and the Mbed platform. I've delved into the intricacies of compiler nuances (ARMCC vs. GCC ARM), mastered library dependencies, and navigated C++ standards â€“ all to create seamless connections between the digital and physical worlds.

*   **Cloud & Other Technologies (The Foundation):**
    *   I've leveraged cloud services like Firebase Realtime Database and Google App Engine to build scalable and resilient applications.
    *   I'm constantly exploring the broader blockchain landscape, keeping a pulse on developments in Polkadot, Substrate, and Ethereum (including Solidity â€“ I'm always learning!).
    *   Git and GitHub are my constant companions for version control and collaborative development. Explore my projects here and see my explorations in open source.

*   **AI (The Catalyst for Transformation):**
    *   I'm actively integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into my projects, leveraging the power of Langchain to build truly intelligent applications.
    *   I'm diving deep into the art of fine-tuning models, aiming to unlock the full potential of AI for specific use cases.

## My Entrepreneurial Drive

I'm not just a coder; I'm a builder. I'm driven by the desire to create, launch, and scale impactful projects. My past experience as the CEO of an IT company, combined with my active engagement in the Southeast Asian tech ecosystem (find me on e27!), fuels my passion for turning innovative ideas into reality.

## My Obsession: The Fusion of Crypto & AI â€“ The Future, Unveiled

I'm not just interested in crypto and AI; I'm *obsessed* with their convergence. I believe this fusion will be the defining technological revolution of our time, unlocking possibilities we can barely imagine today.

**Why Crypto? Beyond the Hype:**

Blockchain technology is far more than just digital currency. It's a fundamental shift in how we build trust, transparency, and ownership into digital systems. I'm particularly captivated by:

*   **DeFi (Reinventing Finance):** I'm driven to create financial systems that are truly *decentralized*, accessible to everyone, and resistant to censorship and manipulation. Imagine a world where financial services are as open and permissionless as the internet itself.
*   **NFTs (Beyond Digital Art):** I see NFTs as the key to unlocking a new era of digital ownership. Beyond art, I'm exploring their potential in:
    *   **Gaming:** Creating truly ownable in-game assets and economies.
    *   **Intellectual Property:** Revolutionizing how we manage and protect creative works.
    *   **Real-World Assets:** Tokenizing physical assets to create new forms of liquidity and investment.
*   **DAOs (The Future of Organizations):** I'm experimenting with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, envisioning a future where collaboration is global, transparent, and governed by code, not bureaucracy.
*   **Solana (My Chosen Ecosystem):** I've chosen to focus on Solana because of its speed, scalability, and vibrant community. I believe it's the ideal platform for building the next generation of decentralized applications.

**Why AI? Unleashing Human Potential:**

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic fantasy; it's a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities and solve some of the world's most pressing challenges. My focus is on:

*   **Machine Learning (Intelligent Systems):** Building and deploying models that can learn from data, make accurate predictions, and automate complex tasks.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP - Bridging the Human-Computer Gap):** Creating applications that can understand, interpret, and respond to human language, opening up new possibilities for interaction and communication.
*   **Langchain (Unlocking the Power of LLMs):** I'm actively exploring Langchain to create sophisticated, LLM-powered applications that can reason, learn, and adapt.
*  **Fine-tuning Models:** I'm dedicated to mastering the art of fine-tuning models to achieve peak performance and unlock the full potential of AI for specific, impactful use cases.

**The Synergy: Where Magic Happens**

The *real* magic happens when we combine the power of crypto and AI. Imagine:

*   **AI-Powered DeFi Protocols:** Smart contracts that leverage AI to dynamically adjust interest rates, optimize trading strategies, and mitigate risks, creating a more efficient and resilient financial system.
*   **Decentralized AI Marketplaces:** Platforms where users can securely train, share, and monetize AI models, fostering collaboration and innovation while ensuring data privacy and ownership.
*   **NFTs Representing AI-Generated Assets:** Unique digital assets that represent ownership of AI-generated art, music, intellectual property, or even entire virtual worlds.
*   **AI-Governed DAOs:** Organizations where AI agents participate in decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring fairness and transparency.
* **Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving AI**: Using Federated learning and zero-knowledge techniques to develop AI models.

I'm not just building for today; I'm building for this future. I'm actively seeking collaborators, partners, and fellow visionaries who share this passion.
